# Flask-Color-Detector
A web application built with Flask that allows users to upload an image and extract the dominant colors from it. The app uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to identify the top k colors in the image and displays them as hex codes. Users can easily see the color palette of any image through a simple and interactive interface.
